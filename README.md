# HRCM - Genome Data Compression Algorithm

This project implements **HRCM**, a genome data compression algorithm designed to efficiently compress large genome files.

## Overview

Genome files can be extremely large, making storage and transfer challenging. The HRCM algorithm reduces the file size by applying specialized compression techniques tailored for genomic data, helping save disk space and speed up data transmission.

## Features

- Compresses large genome files to smaller sizes without losing essential data
- Supports both compression and decompression operations
- Implemented in C++ for high performance

## Included Files

- `compression_updated.cpp` — source code for compressing genome data
- `decompressionArguments.cpp` — source code for decompressing genome data
- `Seminar.pdf` — seminar report explaining the algorithm and its performance

## Usage

1. Must use the FASTA file format and use Linux, the current code uploaded is just the end product code. It cannot function on it's own without fasta files and sequence files for compression.
